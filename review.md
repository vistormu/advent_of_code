## Go
* Pros

- Pure functions
- Built-in enumerate in the for loop
- Separated declaration with pure assignment with :=
- No need of ;

* Cons
- I hate functions with PascalCase
- Not statically typed?!!
- No type methods?
- Too many imports
- Too many variable names
- No way to quickly access the last value of a slice
